Cloud service providers like Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), etc., provide their CIDR network IPv4/6 ranges for consumption. During analysis, we could use WHOIS information to determine ownership of a specific IP address. However, using this OSINT, we can glean additional information on a particular IP address, like possible services operating in specific regions.

Distillery provides AWS Chatbot integration with Slack Channels for cloud IP range lookups.

@aws invoke cidr --payload {"ip": "116.129.226.132‚Äù}
